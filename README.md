# Conceptors

This repo aims to provide a python implementation of H. Jaeger's conceptor network. The original work can be found from [here](http://minds.jacobs-university.de/conceptors).

## Updates

+ Structure sketch
+ First working version [2015-02-26]

## Notes

+ Based on my reading so far, there is really no training for the network. The readout weights and target weights are calculated analytically.

+ I did a test of using two patterns, then it's able to recall barely. (this implementation is purly based on the `test.m` of the file) [2015-02-26]
