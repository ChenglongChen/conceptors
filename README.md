# Conceptors

This repo aims to provide a python implementation of H. Jaeger's conceptor network. The original work can be found from [here](http://minds.jacobs-university.de/conceptors).

## Updates

+ Structure sketch

## Notes

+ Based on my reading so far, there is really no training for the network. The readout weights and target weights are calculated analytically.
